This summer, I had the most amazing trip with my friend Özgür – we spent 10 unforgettable days in Switzerland. We decided to keep things spontaneous, foregoing any advance accommodation bookings, and simply packed a couple of bags along with a 24/7 ticket for the Switzerland Federal Railroads (SBB). This ticket granted us access to the entire Swiss transportation system, with the only caveat being its validity between 7 PM and 5 AM. As a result, we maximized our nights for travel, reserving the daylight hours for leisurely hangouts.

For the record, we spent four nights at our friend Özüm's house, who was doing an internship in Switzerland at the time and joined us on weekends. We also stayed three nights at Batuhan's house, another friend doing an internship in Basel, who joined us on weekends as well. Lastly, we spent three nights at train stations, which turned out to be a adventurous experience. We travelled a distance of 200 km on foot over the 10 days, probably traveling thousands of kilometers overall. It turned out to be one of the most incredible adventures of my life.

Here are the some collage of good memories:
