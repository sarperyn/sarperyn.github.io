# Recommended Resources

## Mathematics

### Videos and Playlist
- [Gilbert Strang lectures on Linear Algebra (MIT)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL49CF3715CB9EF31D). Amazing linear algebra lessons. The best in the universe.
- [Intro to Abstract Algebra and proof techniques in mathematics](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL22w63XsKjqxaZ-v5N4AprggFkQXgkNoP). The algebra part is not detailed but enough to have a basic understanding.
- [Vector Calculus and Partial Differential Equations](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMrJAkhIeNNQromC4WswpU1krLOq5Ro6S)
- [A Brief Introduction to Groups](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KufsL2VgELo&list=WL&index=3&t=31s). Amazing introduction for Group Theory. Especially for who doesn't have a degree in Mathematics. 
- [Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics - Why do we need a Hilbert Space?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nL4SznGPgU&list=WL&index=5)Why do we need Hilbert Spaces right? That's why. 
- [Group theory, abstraction, and the 196,883-dimensional monster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH0oCDa74tE&list=PLTOG9kHXmwlGeO2ZcZpYWndVZNO1UxLnx&index=2) A great video about 'monster group'. A 3blue1brown classic.
- [Visual Group Theory course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwV-9DG53NDxU337smpTwm6sef4x-SCLv)One of the best I have seen in the internet.




### Textbooks
- [Abstract Mathematics](https://www.people.vcu.edu/~rhammack/BookOfProof/Main.pdf). For the people who want to begin abstract mathematics. At the end of the day, one must have a solid understading of the topics book covered.
- [Elementary Differential Geometry](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~spliu/2018DG/ONeill.pdf)Great book to start to learn differential geometry

- [Machine Learning and Bayesian Inference](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdLk2RYEiAhp9Slj6F_LCMXUv7_Fi3V_Y)
- [Probabilistic Machine Learning - Philipp Hennig](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL05umP7R6ij1tHaOFY96m5uX3J21a6yNd)

### Textbooks
- [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://hastie.su.domains/ISLR2/ISLRv2_website.pdf) 
- [Deep Learning](https://www.deeplearningbook.org) One of the best book you can ever find about deep learning. It is written by Ian Goodfellow and Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville, three experts in the field.
