Hi. I am a student of mathematics at Yildiz Technical University in Istanbul, Turkey. I write about many things but mostly mathematics and deep learning. I share my notes and resources I use. Nowadays, generative models, diffusion models, dynamical systems are my study fields. I also interested in Clifford algebra and representation theory. For more information about my work, you can look up my resume by clicking the person button below.
Lastly, I am a big fan of Star Wars, I read manga and watch anime a lot.
