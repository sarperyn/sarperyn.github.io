Hi, I'm Sarper. I enjoy sharing moments from my life, along with some science and mathematics-related content. I also post my notes and share the resources I use. I am mostly interested in solving science problems. To be able to do that, I have completed three internships in different domains, such as astrophysics, computer vision, and topological deep learning. I have utilized deep learning methods, which I consider to be data-driven computational learning techniques.

I am a Master's student at Politecnico di Milano. My bachelor's degree was in mathematics, and now I am pursuing a master's in mathematical engineering.

My favorite manga is "Berserk," and when it comes to anime, I'm torn between "Attack on Titan" (AoT) and "Neon Genesis Evangelion," both of which I consider masterpieces. I also have a soft spot for "Nanatsu no Taizai," "Claymore," and "Violet Evergarden." While "Nanatsu no Taizai" might not have the best graphics or storyline, watching it still gives me chills. On the other hand, "Violet Evergarden" stands out as one of the best anime series I've ever watched—it's incredibly touching. And "Claymore"...
