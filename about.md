Hi, I'm Sarper. I enjoy sharing moments from my life, along with some mathematics content. I also post my notes and share the resources I use. I've completed three internships, all focused on deep learning studies. I am interested in geometry, topology and geometric deep learning. If you're interested in learning more about my professional background, you can check out my resume by clicking the person button below.
I'm a huge fan of Star Wars—I often find myself repeating quotes and scenes. I like reading manga and watching anime. My favorite manga is "Berserk," and when it comes to anime, I'm torn between AoT and Neon Genesis Evangelion, both of which I consider masterpieces. I also have a soft spot for Nanatsu no Taizai, Claymore, and Violet Evergarden. While Nanatsu no Taizai might not boast the best graphics or storyline, but watching it gives me the chill. On the other hand, Violet Evergarden stands out as one of the best anime series I've ever watched—it's incredibly touching..
